You can run the check the project directly by placing the project folder to any running server Or through docker container

## Docker Setup Instructions
Below commands will setup the applications using PHP7-FPM and Nginx

* Make the `www` and `stop` files executable (if not), this will execute docker compose and setup containers
* Run `./www` (or appropriate command) to execute the executable file and if all goes well then this should output some output like below:
```
Creating abdullah_code_challenge     ... done
Creating abdullah_code_challenge_php ... done
Please hit: <CONTAINER_IP_ADDR>
```
* Now use `<CONTAINER_IP_ADDR>` (e.g. 172.23.0.2) link to check the solutions.
* To Stop the project/remove container run `./stop`


That's it! Now You will be able to check my code challenge solutions.
Thanks :-)
